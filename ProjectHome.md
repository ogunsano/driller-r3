Driller is an application for extracting data from binary database files. Currently it only works with the Dentrix database, but additional systems are quite easy to add.

Driller may be run either from the command line, or as a GUI (using the Qt library). It currently supports output to MySQL, flat text files, or (in GUI mode) a window.
